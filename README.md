## Overview
**GLID** is a **G**as **L**ift **I**nstallation **D**ecision-making software, designed for Production and other 
Energy experts for faster and reliable decision making on whether to Gas lift a well or not. 
It's credibility is attributed to it's vast factor considerations leveraging various information of the well 
such as; 
1. Reservoir Characteristics
2. Production information
3. Environmental impact information
4. Economic feasibility information

**Note**: This project is part of a Test Project for a Petroleum Engineering Graduate internship position.

  ## Tools
  This project was built on purely **Python** and **Streamlit** (for the UI). 

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Ekeopara-Praise/Gas-Lift-App.git
```
```
pip install streamlit
```
Now on the terminal, in the file directory, run
```
streamlit run GLID_App.py
```
